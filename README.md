## Summary of Project  
Numbly combines the addictive thrill of Wordle with the excitement of numbers, delivering a brain-boosting puzzle which fosters social interaction and friendly competition for all ages. In the growing $25.86 billion casual gaming market, Numbly stands out by challenging users to think critically, test their luck, and exercise their problem-solving skills (Casual Games). Take a quick break, sharpen your mind, and join a vibrant community of puzzle enthusiasts. How fast can you crack the number of the day?

## Project Analysis

### Value Proposition  
Numbly addresses the challenge of finding enriching and mentally stimulating games within the casual gaming market. With shortening attention spans among today’s youth and the natural decline in cognitive abilities as we age, numerous mindless games fail to engage users’ puzzle-solving and cognitive-driven skills (Zihl and Reppermund). Numbly combines the excitement of guessing games with a daily brain-boosting number puzzle, offering a mix of luck, strategy, and critical thinking. Keeping your brain sharp by playing a quick and accomplishable guessing game has never been easier with Numbly.

### Primary Purpose  
The primary purpose of Numbly is to provide a fun, quick, and mentally stimulating puzzle game that helps users stay sharp while enjoying a casual gaming experience. By combining luck, strategy, and problem-solving, Numbly offers players a unique way to exercise their cognitive abilities daily. The simple, number-based format allows for short, satisfying play sessions that fit into even the busiest of schedules. Numbly aims to cater to the need for brain engagement and personal accomplishment, while fostering friendly competition and collaboration.

### Target Audience  
Numbly is primarily designed for younger audiences ages 16-30, and older audiences ages 40+. Younger audiences often seek fast-paced and engaging games that fit into their daily routines. With decreasing attention spans, younger players are drawn to a quick game that offers a sense of completion in an achievably short amount of time. Numbly affords a fun, mental challenge that may be completed in short breaks without long periods of focus. With the option to share scores and general collaboration, Numbly caters to young social gamers.  
Additionally, Numbly helps older audiences enjoy games that maintain cognitive function, especially as studies reveal puzzles and mental challenges help combat age-related cognitive decline (Zihl and Reppermund). Numbly offers a simple yet challenging puzzle that appeals to older players who want to improve their memory and problem-solving without committing to lengthy or overtly complex games.  

Numbly is ultimately planned to reach these target audiences through mobile app stores, social media campaigns, and targeted television advertising.

### Success Criteria  
The success of Numbly will hinge on user satisfaction, retention rates, and financial gain. Positive reviews and high user-ratings on app stores indicate game-satisfaction; moreover, metrics like session length and daily active users will reflect engagement and product success. Tracking how many players return to the game on a daily or weekly basis will also be a key indicator of success. Retention rates may provide insight into the user experience and whether they enjoyed the game. Success will also be measured by revenue generated through in-app purchases—through hints and premium versions of the application, Numbly’s success will be reflected in financial growth.

## Competitor Analysis  
Numbly faces competition from a variety of popular puzzle games like Wordle and Sudoku, each of which brings its own strengths and weaknesses. Wordle, with its simple word-guessing format, became a viral sensation, offering players a daily puzzle that is quick, challenging, and highly shareable. However, Wordle’s focus on words may not appeal to users who enjoy number-based challenges. Numbly differentiates itself by offering a number puzzle with elements of luck and strategy, providing a fresh twist on the daily puzzle format.  
Sudoku, one of the most enduring number puzzles, has a broad appeal due to its logic-based gameplay and vast number of puzzle variations. However, it can sometimes feel repetitive or too lengthy for players seeking shorter, more casual experiences. Numbly fills this gap by offering quick, daily puzzles that don’t require long periods of focus while still engaging users’ cognitive abilities. Unlike Sudoku’s solo play style, Numbly incorporates social elements such as sharing scores and challenging friends to the puzzle, also appealing to players who enjoy connecting and competing with others.

## Monetization Model  
Numbly will adopt a free model, where the app is free to download and play, with optional in-app purchases and ads to generate revenue. Non-intrusive ads could be shown between puzzles or as opt-in ads for hints, ensuring they don’t disrupt gameplay. In-app purchases offer users the choice to buy hints, access additional puzzle modes, or remove ads through a one-time purchase or subscription model. Additionally, Numbly could offer a premium ad-free version with extra features, such as exclusive puzzles, themed events, or additional customization options.

## Initial Design  

### UI/UX Design  
The UI/UX for the MVP will emphasize simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that both target audiences are able to easily understand and play. The puzzle interface is laid out in an intuitive fashion with a five-by-five grid representing user guesses. Navigation of the application is straightforward, with clearly marked sections for the puzzle, hints, sharing scores, and settings features. Colors and animations are engaging for the product but not too distracting or overwhelming for both audiences.

### Technical Architecture  
The MVP must store progress locally in a data structure such as an array of guesses. There also must be a puzzle-generator algorithm that randomly chooses each digit for the number of the day. 3rd party dependencies may be useful in the integration with social media platforms; APIs could be useful for sharing results in addition to ad networks for monetization.

## Challenges and Open Questions  
Technical challenges like social feature-scalability may be difficult to integrate; ensuring the app can handle a growing user base means incorporating social media to engage younger audiences. Additionally, keeping users engaged in the long term may be difficult in a crowded gaming market; regularly introducing new features and updates may keep the game engaging over time. Storage of the own users’ scores may not need cloud storage but may pose an issue over time.  
To combat this, users' high scores may also just be kept locally and reset when requested to be manually cleared out.

In general, Numbly could focus on expanding its types of puzzles (i.e., provide a digit range for the number of the day), or keep the gameplay more consistent with a five-digit number every day. Maybe premium features allow for the adjustment of these settings, and the free basic version offers the simple interface expected every day.
The scope of this project may pose challenges in development, but focusing on the main value, ease-of-use, may guide the game toward simplicity.
